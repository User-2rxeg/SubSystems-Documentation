## 📊 PAYROLL TRACKING FLOW

**This epic focuses on transparency, employee empowerment, and financial accountability. It allows employees to access payslips, submit claims, and view deductions while enabling Payroll, Finance, and HR teams to approve, refund, and audit these activities.**

### 🔍 What This Process Does (Simplified)

This is a 4-phase transparency cycle that:
1. Employees access payslips and track their salary details online
2. Operational teams generate compliance and departmental reports
3. Payroll and managers review and approve disputes and expense claims
4. Finance generates and processes refunds for approved items in the next payroll cycle

Each phase builds on the previous to create employee empowerment with organizational oversight.

# 📚 KEY DEFINITIONS: UNDERSTANDING REQUIREMENTS, USER STORIES, FLOWS & BUSINESS RULES

## What Are These Different Types, and Why Do They Matter?

### 🎯 REQUIREMENTS (General Concept)

**What it is:** A statement of something the system MUST do or support.

**Example:** "The system must allow employees to view and download their payslips"

**Why it matters:** Requirements define what functionality employees and staff need from the system.

---

### 👤 USER STORIES (REQ-PY)

**What it is:** A specific need written from a user's perspective showing WHO wants something, WHAT they want, and WHY.

**Format:** "As a [ROLE], I want [ACTION], so that [BENEFIT]"

**Example:** "As an Employee, I want to view my payslip details so that I understand my salary calculation."

**Real-World Translation:** Sarah, an employee, logs into the payroll portal and sees her detailed payslip with all components listed. She understands exactly how her salary is calculated.

**Why it matters:** 
- Makes requirements human-centered (focuses on actual user needs)
- Clear about who uses it and why (helps developers understand context)
- Can be tested ("Can Sarah successfully view her payslip?")
- Links to business value (why we're building this feature)

---

### 🔧 BUSINESS RULES (BR)

**What it is:** A specific technical/operational rule that the system MUST enforce.

**Example:** "BR-17: An auto-generated Payslip should be available through the system with a clear breakdown of components."

**Real-World Translation:** "Every payslip generated by the system must show all components (base salary, allowances, taxes, deductions) in an easy-to-read format."

**Why it matters:**
- Defines exact logic developers must code
- Ensures consistency (all payslips follow the same format)
- Creates auditability (payslips are documented and traceable)
- Links to legal/compliance requirements

---

### 🌊 FLOWS (Process Flows)

**What it is:** A step-by-step description of HOW the system works.

**Example:**
```
Employee logs into portal
  → Views payslip dashboard
  → Selects a payslip
  → Views all salary components
  → Downloads PDF
  → Can dispute if error found
```

**Real-World Translation:** The entire process an employee goes through to access their salary information.

**Why it matters:**
- Shows sequence of operations (order matters)
- Helps everyone understand the big picture
- Identifies where things can fail
- Makes testing easier

### 🔗 THE CONNECTIONS (How They Work Together)

```
USER STORY (What the user needs)
    ↓
BUSINESS RULES (The specific rules for implementing it)
    ↓
FLOW (The step-by-step process)
    ↓
SYSTEM (Code that makes it all work)
```

**Real Example:**

| Part | Details |
|------|---------|
| **REQ-PY-1 (User Story)** | "As an Employee, I want to view and download my payslip online so that I can see my monthly salary." |
| **BR-17 (Business Rule)** | "An auto-generated Payslip should be available through the system with a clear breakdown of components." |
| **FLOW (Process)** | (1) Employee logs in, (2) Selects payslip, (3) Views all components, (4) Downloads PDF |
| **IMPLEMENTATION** | Developer codes: "Generate payslips with all components visible. Allow PDF download. Secure access by employee only." |

---

**Why This Structure Matters for System Implementation:**

1. **User Stories** ensure developers build what users actually need
2. **Business Rules** ensure every company rule is enforced consistently
3. **Flows** ensure everything happens in the right order with proper controls
4. **Together** they create a complete, transparent, auditable employee self-service system
